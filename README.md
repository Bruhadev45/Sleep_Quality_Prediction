# Sleep Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict sleep quality using machine learning techniques applied to sleep-related data. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development, along with a dataset in Excel format.

## Repository Contents

* **Sleep Quality Prediction.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
* **Sleep\_Data.xlsx**: An Excel file comprising the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the notebook:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bruhadev45/Sleep_Quality_Prediction.git
   cd Sleep_Quality_Prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Sleep Quality Prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## Project Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:

* Loads and preprocesses the sleep dataset.
* Conducts exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
* Builds and trains machine learning models to predict sleep quality.
* Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics.([arXiv][1])
